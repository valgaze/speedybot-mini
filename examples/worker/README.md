# [QUICKSTART]

Note: The steps below assume you have a working WebEx account & **[Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)** 16.7+

## 1. Fetch repo & install deps

```
git clone https://github.com/valgaze/speedybot-mini
cd speedybot-mini/examples/deno
npm i
```

## 2. Set your bot access token

- If you have an existing bot, get its token here: **[https://developer.webex.com/my-apps](https://developer.webex.com/my-apps)**

- If you don't have a bot, create one and save the token from here: **[https://developer.webex.com/my-apps/new/bot](https://developer.webex.com/my-apps/new/bot)**

- Write down your bot's access token, you'll need it in a minute

## 3. Get your bot URL

- If you don't have one already, get a **[cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)**

- Authenticate your machine with `npx wrangler login`

- Create a new "worker" from the **[cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)** & note its URL (you can name it something like https://speedybot1234.username.workers.dev)

## 4. Add your bot token "secret"

From the same directory as the repo run the following command to add a secret called `BOT_TOKEN` and enter your info

```sh
npx wrangler secret put BOT_TOKEN
```

## 5. Deploy your agent

From the same directory as the repo run this command to deploy your agent (now bound with your `BOT_TOKEN` secret)

```
npm run deploy
```

## 4. 6egister your webhooks

- Make a note the URL of the deployed function (ie http://speedybot-mini.username.workers.dev)

- Use **[speedybot bot-garage ðŸ”§ðŸ¤–](https://codepen.io/valgaze/full/MWVjEZV)** to set up webhooks that point to your function
